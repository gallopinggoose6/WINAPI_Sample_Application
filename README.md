# WINAPI_Sample_Application

The Graphical Parts of an Application I developed for the National Institute of Standards and Technology
I'm keeping this around (with permission) so that I can more quickly develop future projects involving Visual C++ Desktop Programming in the future.
I will get around to properly putting comments everywhere shortly.

I have compiled this inside of Visual Studio Community 2019. A Debug with binaries are not included in this respoitory, build it yourself!
